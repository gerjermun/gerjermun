# Hi there! 👋 I'm Germán

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate data scientist, machine learning engineer, and software developer with a keen interest in leveraging Python to tackle complex problems. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors as an avid canoeist and runner.

## 🔬 Expertise

- **Data Science:** Leveraging data to gain insights and make informed decisions is my passion. Whether it's exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, or building data pipelines, I'm always excited to dive deep into the world of data.
  
- **Machine Learning Engineering:** I enjoy building and deploying machine learning models that solve real-world problems. From preprocessing data to training models and deploying them in production, I love every step of the ML lifecycle.
  
- **Software Development:** Crafting clean, efficient, and maintainable code is at the heart of everything I do. I have experience in developing scalable software solutions, and I'm always eager to learn new technologies and best practices.

## 🚀 Projects

## 🏃‍♂️ Hobbies

Outside of the tech world, you'll often find me outdoors, either paddling down rivers or hitting the trails for a run. As an athlete in canoeing and running, I find that these activities not only keep me physically fit but also provide a great opportunity to clear my mind and recharge.
